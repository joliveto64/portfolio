        <div class="about-me-text">
        <p><mark class="story">Here's the story:</mark> I've been working in physical therapy since 2014. On the whole, it‚Äôs been great! I've accumulated a wealth of knowledge and experiences and even had the opportunity to teach a few college courses. While this career has been rewarding, I feel that I've gotten all I can out of it. I'll cherish the memories, but it's time for a change.</p>
        
        <p>It was a close friend who first piqued my interest in computer science. I initially thought it was something I would never enjoy, yet I agreed to try a brief, online fundamentals course‚Äîa "Hello World" type of course. To my surprise, I found it immensely enjoyable and was soon hooked, eager to learn more. Later, this same friend and I made a shared decision: we were ready for something new. With a dash of drama, we quit our jobs and journeyed for about seven months. While traveling, I used my spare time to advance my newfound interest. As I developed my skills and traveled deeper into the world of programming, I found myself growing more passionate. Upon our return, I chose to learn full-time, paving the way for a career shift.</p>

        <p>I never imagined finding joy in this line of work, turning out so wrong was pleasantly surprising. My only regret is that I didn't discover programming sooner! Naturally, such a profound change came with its fair share of challenges. The learning curve was steep, but shaping an idea into something tangible, functional, and useful is incredibly satisfying. Amazingly, programming seems to tap into the same love for problem-solving that I usually satisfy with video games‚Äîwho would've guessed!
        </p>

        <p>So, that's my journey so far. It's been an exciting ride, and now, I think it's time to turn this hobby into a full-fledged career. I am aware that this is just the beginning and there's much more to learn, but I'm prepared and welcome this new challenge. Looking forward to speaking with you soon. Cheers! üçª</p>
