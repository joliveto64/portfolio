              <p>A for-fun project built using the P5 library, a JavaScript library with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists and designers. As the name states, this project randomly generates (moving) clouds!

                Using The Color API, this project generates a color palette based on a selected color and scheme (such as monochrome, complement and analogic among others). Both RGB and HEX values can be copied on click! This app is responsive.

              <p>Another for-fun project built with P5! This one is a bit more complex than the cloud generator, featuring fireworks of random size and color that launch along whichever vertical axis you touch (or click). The cityscape is randomly generated with every refresh and the fireworks leave smoke behind!

              <p>
                Using data from the Calorie Ninjas API, this project generates values to represent satiety (level of satisfaction) for any food available in the database. By comparing different foods, you can identify which ones are more likely to keep you fuller, longer! This app is responsive.

        <p><mark class="story">Here's the story:</mark> I've been working in healthcare (physical therapy) since 2014. It's been a great time! I've experienced and learned a lot and was even lucky enough to teach a few college courses! I chose healthcare as a career path when I was maybe 17 and have had well over a decade to consider my life and the kind of future I see for myself. </p>
        <p>In 2022, a close friend and I left our jobs and traveled for about 7 months. During that time, I also got to work. I started learning the fundamentals of web development part-time while we explored. This was a sort of trial period. And, well, you know what I decided! After we returned I decided to continue my learning full-time.</p>
        <p>I never thought I would, or could, enjoy this type of work. I have since realized that I was sorely mistaken; my only regret now is that I didn't discover it sooner! Such a radical change has of course come with plenty of challenges, and this learning process has definitely not been easy, but it's clear that I've grown quite addicted. The creative process of starting with merely a thought and problem-solving my way to a solution with real, tangible results is just incredible. I had never really viewed programming as an art form, but I definitely do now. It's just tons of fun!</p>
        <p>This is without a doubt what I want to do now. I know this is only the beginning of a long journey and there's much, much left to learn, but I couldn't be more excited! I look forward to speaking with you, cheers! üçª </p>
